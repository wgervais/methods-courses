# methods-courses

"intro-methods" describes an introductory (second year) undergraduate methods course.

"replicability" is a more advanced undergraduate methods course that I taught about the ongoing era of methodological rethinking in psychology.

"evidence-seminar" was a conceptual statistics seminar I taught where we pondered the nature of statistical evidence from different statistical approaches (frequentist, Bayesian) and got our feet wet with basic probability theory.

"grad methods" is my most recent graduate methods class. we really dive into things.
